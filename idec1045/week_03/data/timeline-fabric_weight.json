These weights are good for more structured treatments like upholstered valances, swag treatments or lambrequins where they can be stapled into a fixed place.  Drapery that is stationary can also work if the fabric drapes well enough so that it will not be too heavy to open and close on a rod.</p>\n <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n<figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/heavy_weight.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\" \" /><figcaption>This structured swag and jabot treatment valance is suitable for thsi space as the treatment does not move and is fixed in place.<br /><cite>© iStock.com/stockyImages</cite></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n                  </div>\n                </div>",

They can drape well depending on their fiber content, can open and close with more ease.  Medium weight fabrics are generally not as stiff as heavy weight fabrics and have a better “hand”.  They come in all fibers from natural to synthetic and all blends and some examples are satin, some velvets, and taffeta. </p>\n <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n<figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/medium_weight.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\" \" /><figcaption>This medium weight fabric treatment pleats well and has nice drape on these windows.
