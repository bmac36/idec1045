        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply the techniques of dimensioning and elevating to scale</li>
          <li>Develop floor plan layouts for various rooms of the house</li>
          <li>Identify conditions and limitations involved in space planning, including standard rooms and furniture dimensions</li>
          <li>Outline sample gathering processes to prepare for presentation to clients</li>
          <li>Establish adequate practices to create presentation boards</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This final project includes 3 design boards (2 drawing boards with elevations, textures and electrical overlays, 1 sample board to include both rooms on 1 board), an essay of 1,000 words or more and a video presentation describing their design.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>As the decorator, you are to design 2 rooms for an imaginary &quot;client&quot; placed on a total of 3 presentation boards.</p>

                <li>Board 2 &mdash; Bedroom or Kitchen </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Specifications</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Determine who the client is, including # of people using the space, style, colour scheme, lifestyle, uses of space etc.</li>
                <li>Do not use rooms, colour or styles already used in previous final projects</li>
                <li>Using what has been learned throughout the semester; design an ideal space for the client.</li>
                <li>Floor plans and elevations on presentation boards as well as providing samples of materials used such as flooring, window treatments, furniture, bedding, cabinets, counters etc. as per room selected will be required</li>
                <li>All selections must be real (furniture). You are expected to research actual sizes of furniture, cabinets etc. Samples are your choice of texture and colour</li>
                <li>Information such as your name, room title, scale, direction arrow placed together on right side of board</li>
                <li>Board will be graded on neatness, impression of board design and layout, accuracy, clear understanding of plan, accurate style interpretation</li>

			<li>Upload to dropbox by the due date and time:<br />
                  <ol>
	        <li>Original graph paper working copies. I do not care what these look like, however I need to see your original work.</li>
	        <li>Scan all 3 of your boards and place in a word document<br />
	        <strong>NOTE:</strong> For the final project you can get your large vellum scanned at places like Staples. The cost is under $10 for a whole job (no matter how many pages). This is important to be able to accurately see your project drawings and details. You can take photos of your 3 boards as close as possible in good light and straight on the board so that the instructor can see your work as if they had it in person.</li>
	        <li>Video about 5-10 minutes long presenting your project. Talk about your client and style. Explain what you designed for each room in detail. Dress for a business meeting for a professional presentation as if we were in person.</li>
