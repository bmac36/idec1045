													<h3>Types of Fibers</h3>
													<p>There are two types of manufactured fibers: Regenerated and Synthetic.</p>
													<p><strong>Regenerated fibers</strong>, also known as man-made, are made from natural materials by processing to a fiber called cellulosic or semi-synthetic.   These fibers are re-generated from cellulose in cotton and wood pulp such as rayon and acetate.  <strong>Cellulosic fibers</strong> are <strong>organic</strong> meaning that they are natural materials that are mixed with chemicals to produce a fiber.  These natural materials are plant based and had a life that grew from a seed to a plant.</p>
													<p><strong>Non-cellulosic fibers</strong> are <strong>inorganic</strong> and are made completely from man-made materials such as carbon, glass, metal and ceramic. These types of fibers are considered true synthetics.</p>

                           <!--Main - Right Col-->
                       <div class="col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-0 col-md-5 col-md-offset-0 col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-0">
												 <h3>Extrusion</h3>
												<p>All synthetic fibers are converted to a liquid state and chemically converted to a fiber by being forced through spinnerets that look like a shower head to form a thread via a process known as extrusion.  </p>
													<p>The threads are then twisted to gain strength to form a fiber.  The extrusion process can create different thicknesses, which we refer to as denier.  <strong>Denier</strong> is a kind of measurement that determines the fineness of individual thread weightings.  A high denier count will be a thick fiber and a low denier count will be more sheer, soft or silky.  Depending on the kind of fiber being created, they can be produced in many different deniers to give different end results.  The fibers are then woven in many different ways to produce cloth. </p>

            <h2>Interesting Fact</h2>
						<p>  Today synthetics are about 50% of all fabric manufacturing.  Natural and synthetic fibers are often combined to enhance their positive properties in a fabric.</p>
