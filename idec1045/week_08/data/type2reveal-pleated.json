Finished width = 2\" past + 6\" trim + 60\" window = 6\" trim + 2\" past = <strong>finished width of treatment 76\" with 4\" returns</strong> (84\" - 4\" - 4\" returns = 76\")</li> \n <li>Pleated header treatment is 2 ½\" fullness to pleat the treatment to cover this area.</li> \n <li>84\" x 2.5 fullness = 210\" + 6\" selvage edge finishing (as valace is sewn together as 1 panel = 216\" fabric width.</li> \n <li>Since fabric is 54\" wide, you need to see how many cuts of 54\" fabric you need to allow 216\" of width.</li> \n <li>216\" divided by 54\" = <strong>4 cuts</strong>.
