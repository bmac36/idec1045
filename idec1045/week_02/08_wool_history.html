													<p class="top-padding">Wool is the dense warm coat usually from sheep and is also known as fleece.  This fleece can come from llamas, goats and camels as well.</p>
													<h3>The History</h3>
													<p>Anthropologists believe the use of wool came from the need to survive.  In the Neolithic age about 8,000 BC people wore pelts as clothing to keep warm and by 4,000BC people were wearing wool clothing crudely made of woven fabric.  By this time herds of wool making animals began to develop.  </p>
                           <h3>Britain takes the reigns on wool</h3>
													<p>The first wool factory in England was in 50AD in Winchester by the Romans.  Wool was recognized as one of the most practical fabrics to keep warm and by the 11th and 12th century there was a prospering wool trade.  The English became expert at raising sheep and the Flemish were expert at the processing of it.  As a result, the English sold the wool to the Flemish who processed the raw material and re-sold it back to the English to make fabric.  </p>

												 <p class="top-padding">Britain made laws to stimulate the domestic production of wool and resulted in Judges, professors and students wearing robes made of English wool.  Even today English judges and others wear wool wigs.  Competition with the American colonies resulted in the English passing laws to protect their “golden fleece”.  One law even threatened the amputation of a hand if a colonist tried to improve the blood line of American sheep.</p>
												 <p>In 1797, the British brought 13 Merino sheep to Australia and started the Merino sheep industry there.  Australia was a colony of the British and they used the island to send prisoners from the overcrowded prison system in England. Some British settlers also went there.  Since then, Australia has become famous for their sheep and wool industry.  Other major producers are New Zealand, USA, Argentina, China and South Africa.  Australia is still the leading supplier, producing 25% of the world production.  Cotton is the #1 fiber that is plant based and wool the #1 fiber from animals.</p>

            <h2>Wool Facts</h2>
						<p> In scientific terms wool is a protein called keratin.  There are about 40 different breeds of sheep and around 200 types of wool in today’s global industry.</p>
						<p>Wool is comprised of an outer layer of scales that are similar to fish scales called a cuticle.  The inner structure is called the <strong>cortex</strong> and is comprised of millions of cigar shape cells that crimp in the wool fiber.
