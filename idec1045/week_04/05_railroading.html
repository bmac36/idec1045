            <h3>A Definition</h3>
            <p>Railroading is referring to how the fabric is printed either vertical or horizontal.  It is often used by the upholstery industry to allow a fabric to be used in one piece across the length of a piece of furniture without seams.  Since many upholstered fabrics can also be used for window treatments it is important to check if it is “railroaded” or “up the roll”.  Up the roll refers to a pattern that is vertical between the selvage edges and a railroad pattern is one that is horizontal between the selvage.</p>

            <h3>What to look for</h3>
            <p> When purchasing fabric on a bolt in person you can see which way the pattern runs.  When ordering from a sample fabric book, you MUST check the back of the sample to see if it is railroaded.  Sometimes the fabric book will show a fabric that has a horizontal pattern but they will show it vertical in the book! Most fabrics are not railroaded, however if ordering from a sample book make sure to check that the pattern (often a stripe) is running the way you want it to. </p>

          <h3>In My Experience</h3>
          <p>I tell you about railroading because I made this costly mistake only once early in my career!  I ordered a stripe expecting it to be vertical for a window treatment.  My seamstress called me to inquire if I really wanted a horizontal stripe.  To my horror I realized that the stripe was going the wrong way.  I had to return the fabric that cost me several hundred dollars in a re-stocking and shipping fees as I ordered about 25 yards.  I then had to inform the client and reselect a fabric.  It was a very expensive and embarrassing experience for me and an annoyance for my client that I will never make again!</p>
