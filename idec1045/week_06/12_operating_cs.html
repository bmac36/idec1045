<p>Let's walk through an actual example for operating, or functioning, draperies from start to finish. We'll begin with all the information required to get started, perform all the required calculations and finally order/purchase the fabric and lining for the window treatment.</p>

<p>Here are the measurements you need to get started. As we discussed earlier, draw out your window and add your measurements to the drawing before beginning the next step &ndash; calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ceiling height: 8'</li>
<li>Window size: 5&rsquo; (60&rdquo;) wide x 4&rsquo; (48&rdquo;) high</li>
<li>Measurement from window to ceiling: 18&rdquo;</li>
<li>Trim added to outside of window: 6"</li>
<li>This is a plain fabric that is 54&rdquo; wide, with pinch pleats and a standard lining.</li>
<li>Rod is a decorative rod with 2&rdquo; rings.</li>
<li>Hang treatment 4&rdquo; above the trim</li>
<li>Draw the window to &frac12;&rdquo; scale on graph paper for your working copy</li>

<p>Below is a diagram of a working copy showing the window measurements. Write anything you need to remember on this page to help you calculate. No one sees this page but you.</p>

<p>Now that we have all of the measurements, we need to start and have drawn out our sketch of the window and added the measurements to it, it is time find the finished width and length of the fabric, and the length of the rod required.</p>
<h3>Width</h3>
<ul>
<li>Functioning (operating) treatments need more calculations.  This is not difficult but it is important to write down ALL necessary calculations.  I like to write it across the top of my drawing to make sure I include all numbers needed.</li>
	<li>This is an operating treatment so a stack-back is needed on each side of the window so the treatment can fully open off the window.  Stack-back is &frac13; of the window width.  Since the window is 5’ or 60” in width: 60" x .33m / 2= 9.9 or 10” needed on each side of the window.  Add this calculation to the width of the window.</li>
	<li>Overlap calculation needs to be added as 4” to the drawing</li>
	<li>When calculating the amount of fabric width needed, add all the measurements up across the window as follows in this example from left to right on the drawing:</li>
	<li>10” stack-back + 6” trim + 60” window + 4” overlap + 6” trim + 10” stack-back = 96” of area that needs to be covered at 2.5 fullness to make the pleating.  96” x 2.5 = 240” + 6 "+ 6" selvage edges = 252” of fabric width required.</li>
	<li>54” fabric is being used.  How many 54” pieces (cuts) of fabric are needed to cover?</li>
	<li>252” / 54” of fabric for each cut = 4.6 cuts.  This means that you need 4.6 pieces of 54” fabric to make the treatment that will open and close over the window. </li>
	<li><strong>You cannot have part of a cut</strong> so you must round up to the next full number: <strong>5 cuts needed</strong></li>
	<li>Rod width equals the amount of area needed, which was calculated previously. This showed how much area needs to be covered and is 96” -  4” overlap = 92” rod length.</li>
<li>Finials will be added to the ends</li>
</ul>
<h3>Length:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measure from floor to top of trim = 78&rdquo;</li>
<li>Add 4&rdquo; above the trim = 78&rdquo;+ 4&rdquo; = 82&rsquo;= where the rod is hung</li>
<li>Rings are 2&rdquo; diameter so must deduct 2&rdquo; from the drape length (that hangs down from the rod) = 82-2&rdquo; = 80&rdquo;</li>
<li>Want &frac12; &ldquo; from the floor for full length = 79 &frac12;&rdquo; finished length</li>

<p>The finished lengths of fabric and lining are calculated, but this is <em>not</em> the amount to order. When ordering the fabric, it is necessary to add the fabric needed to make the hem and <a role="button" href="#/" id="tt-top" class="tooltips-link" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Pleat style">header</a>. The finished length is 79.5&rdquo; in length and we need to determine how much fabric is needed for the hem and header.</p>
<p>Here are the things we need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For all pleated drapery always add 16&rdquo; for hem and header.</strong></li>
<li>You need to add 79.5&rdquo; + 16&rdquo; = 95.5&rdquo; minimum length. This is the order length needed to make the panel.</li>
<li>The width is already calculated and we know that we need 5 cuts of 54&rdquo; fabric.</li>
<li>5 cuts X 95.5 length per cut = 477.5&rdquo;</li>
<li>When ordering, you always do so by the yard. There are 36&rdquo; in a yard so you divide 477.5 by 36 which gives you 13.26 yards.</li>
<li><strong>Always round up</strong> to allow for errors or flaws in fabric so you would order 13.5 yards minimum of fabric to makes these operating drapes.</li>
<li>You will always order by the yard, not inches. In some cases you can also order by the meter which is equal to about 39&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>How much to round up?</strong> To be safe, always round up to the next quarter yard or more. A bit more fabric will allow for errors or flaws in the fabric and it is always better to have too much fabric than not enough and have to re-order! Remember, you need the same dye lot.</li>
<li>Since the fabric has no pattern you would order the same amount of lining.</li>
<li>If you had a pattern repeat, you would add this to the length of <em>each</em> cut of fabric to allow matching of pattern.</li>
<li>You would adapt the measurements according to the height you want to hang the treatment and how far off the window you want the treatment to be.</li>

<h2>Things to Remember</h2>
<p>Here are some key things to remember when working with measurements for Stationary panels:</p>
<p class="small"><em>Hover over each link for additional information.</em></p>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Measurements of window, trim, walls, ceiling height, kind of treatment, drawing the &frac12; scale</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> <a role="button" href="#/" id="tt-top" class="tooltips-link" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="number of cuts, selvage, fullness">Finished width</a>, <a role="button" href="#/" id="tt-top" class="tooltips-link" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="how high above window, how long">finished length</a>, <a role="button" href="#/" id="tt-top" class="tooltips-link" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="window, trim and past window distance">rod length</a>, overlap of 4-inches to avoid a gap between panels when closed together, stack-back if needed</p>
<p><strong>Part 3:</strong> Add hem and header to finished length, pattern repeat if any, round up to nearest &frac14; to &frac12; yard. This is the amount you need to order to get your desired finished treatment.</p>
