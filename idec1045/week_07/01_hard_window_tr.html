                           <h3>Trends Past and Present</h3>
													<p>For the past number of years there has been a strong trend to use hard treatments on windows such as blinds and shutters. They usually operate with cords on the right or left of the window frame and increasingly today with remote control.  Remote control now even can be programed to work from your tablet or cell phone!   They are especially popular in condos and homes with two story windows.   Overall hard window treatments provide an easy care, tailored look that suit most styles of d&eacute;cor.  </p>
													<p>Over the years the popularity of these treatments has improved the options available so that today there are hundreds of choices, colours, textures and style to choose from. They offer a great alternative to soft fabric treatments and can be used on their own or layered with soft treatments as well.</p>

                           <!--Main - Right Col-->

                           <h3>Variety is the Spice of Life</h3>
												 <p>There is no one treatment that is suitable for every room or every home and this lesson will describe a range of options and uses.  </p>
												 <p>Hard window treatments like soft, offer privacy, sun protection and insulation to a window or door.   When selecting any kind of window treatment it is important to consider the needs of each room and what is best for that location.  I have often seen some streets where every home has the same treatment showing from the street, however not every home functions the same way and so one kind of treatment will not be the best choice for all homes. </p>
												 <p> What you will learn this lesson will allow you to make a more knowledgeable selection of blinds and shutters for every room in a home to suit the needs of those using it.</p>
