              <p>In this section, you will be able to identify various career options. It is important to be able to understand what kinds of jobs you can expect once you graduate. Showing you the kinds of areas that fall under this heading can open new
                options for you that you may not have considered. It can also allow you to identify particular areas of interest that you can pursue as a career. Once you graduate from this program you will be fully qualified to work in all residential
                decorating and you can do so with confidence. </p>
              <p>Decorating is a very personal thing in our lives. It is a way to express our individual taste and preferences. It shows our personality. If we all lived in the same style of home on a street, all our interiors would be different because
                we all have different interests, lifestyles, and family dynamics.</p>
              <p>Decorating is subjective…what one might find beautiful is not what the next person would select. You will be made aware that decorating is a science as well as an art. Everything a trained decorator recommends is for a reason. A particular
                sofa colour, size, style and placement is all for a reason. You will be learning these reasons. It is not a hit or miss idea but based on rules that we will learn throughout the semester. </p>
              <p>As you move through the semester you will gain knowledge and learn why you are choosing certain colours or décor items. It is something that you may be doing now, but not really knowing why. You will learn to train your eye to what you are
                seeing in a space.</p>
              <h2>Decorating is also a fashion</h2>
              <p>Trends, colours and styles come and go. About every decade we have some change in fashion. That is why we can look at some decorating and see it as out of date. What we thought was fashionable 20 years ago is now seen as old. It is important
                for a decorator to keep up with the current trends and innovations in décor. We will go deeper into this more in future classes.</p>
              <h2>Difference between an Interior Designer and Interior Decorator</h2>
              <p>You need to be properly educated in decorating today as the public expects an expert and not just someone who has a knack or an eye for decorating. Decorators are liable for what they recommend to a client.</p>
              <p>There are differences between an Interior Decorator and Interior Designer. Many industry professionals do not know this and need to understand the differences in order to not be sued by misrepresenting themselves. It is common for the public
                to mix up these two terms. </p>
              <h2>An Interior Designer:</h2>
              <p>The Interior Designer must graduate from certain colleges only, that are more detailed and longer years of education, complete a 2-year apprenticeship and must continue to take courses through ARIDO and or IDC to maintain their qualification.
                They learn both commercial and residential design and structure. They are qualified more like an architect dealing with construction and safely of the environment and not just how to alter the look of a space. </p>
              <p>There is an Ontario Law, Bill Pr6, that states that only certain criteria allow one to call themselves an Interior designer. The IDC (Interior Designers of Canada) website explains Canadian requirements. ARIDO (Association of Registered
                Interior Designers of Ontario) can also help.</p>
              <h2>An Interior Decorator: </h2>
              <p>While a person can call themselves an Interior decorator without education, that is changing quickly as the public expects a qualified person in this area. Interior Decorators are trained in residential decorating, some in both residential
                and commercial decorating. This course is intended for residential decorating.</p>
              <p>Decorators work with existing structures and change the appearance of the space. You will not train in house construction; so if walls need to be moved or added, you will rely on a contractor to guide you as to the structural needs to accomplish
                this. </p>
              <p>Most of the public do not know the difference and it is important for you to assure the public that you are qualified to help them. </p>
              <p>I graduated from Sheridan College school of Interior Design as an Interior Designer. In my 30+ years in this industry I chose not to join ARIDO and when the law came into effect I could no longer call myself an Interior Designer and had
                to change to Interior Decorator. It has not had any negative impact on my career at all. I am able to do anything I need to do for a client with the credentials I represent and you will too. I have worked with clients building new homes
                from the blue print stage onward, done renovations, decorating existing spaces, colour selection, furniture, window coverings, flooring, kitchen and bath design and all other areas of decorating for the home.</p>
