              <h2>Have one’s own business with a business location of a store or office outside of the home</h2>
              <p>In this field you can consult with clients and purchase furniture, accessories, drapery and other décor items. This business requires having a firm business plan, acquire proper insurances (building, car and liability), advertising and business
                licenses. </p>
              <p>It does require evening and weekend meetings with clients. A business license allows one to attend trade shows, trade only purchasing at wholesale prices. In some cases, you need to set up trade contracts, decorator discounts with retailers,
                and set client pricing. If you have a retail location you can have items for sale at this location from just accessories to furniture, paint, window treatments etc. as you wish.</p>
              <p>An office will give a professional space to meet clients and present ideas. It can provide a space for a client to come to the decorator, have items delivered there and carry samples from the trades.</p>
              <h2>Have one’s own business from home</h2>
              <p>While you can work from home, you will have to source samples like wallpaper, paint and fabrics from other areas. Companies will not supply to home based businesses. This kind of business however can be full or part time as wanted. You will
                have to meet clients at their home only. You will still need a business license, insurances, advertising, pricing to clients and trades researched and established for yourself.</p>
              <p>As a rule, I recommend that the student NOT open their own business full or part time right away. I strongly suggest that you work for someone before opening your own business to get a feel for the industry and understand that the business
                end is very important to learn first.</p>
              <h2>Work for another decorator in their business</h2>
              <p>There are some larger decorating businesses that hire educated decorators. You work with clients and provide services that this decorator offers. You do not need any kind of business license for this job as you are working for someone else.</p>
              <h2>Retail</h2>
              <p>There are many jobs in this field that offer great experience and opportunities for decorators. All décor related industry want experts in their business from furniture, window treatments, paint and wallpaper, flooring and appliances. You
                can select colour, create space plans, coordinate items, and do in home consultations with a client. It is a great learning experience for the decorator to gain experience in all fields of decorating to become an expert in all areas. Most
                of these jobs also allow to attend trade shows that the business attends.</p>
              <h2>Builders and new home construction</h2>
              <p>There are many opportunities in this area. Helping select interior and exterior surfaces, upgrades and paint colours for new home builds. You would work directly with the client and larger builders have showrooms to work in.</p>
              <h2>Sales reps</h2>
              <p>All industries servicing the decorating industry need reps to sell to the decorator/designer businesses. Having a decorating background only helps sell the product to the industry and you can carry several companies in your business where
                you would travel a certain area supplying the businesses in cities within those boundaries. You will need a business license, proper insurance for this kind of career.</p>
              <h2>Staging</h2>
              <p>This area of décor is growing all the time. More real-estate brokers are seeing the benefits of using staging to sell a home. You have the opportunity to also get the same client to decorate the home they move to. </p>
              <h2>Kitchen and Bath</h2>
              <p>Designing kitchens and bathrooms is always in need. There are many businesses that specialize in this area for new construction or remodel. You will learn kitchen and bath design in this course that can help you enter into this field and
                several of our grads have chosen this area of expertise.</p>
              <h2>Niche markets</h2>
              <p>Some decorators have an interest in a niche market. This could be focusing on child décor or disabled groups like Autism or helping seniors downsize and make safe environments for them as they move to retirement homes. </p>
