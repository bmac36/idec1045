Look at the far right where it says COLD CELLAR: this is the area below the front porch. To the left of that is an area showing dotted lines. Dotted lines in the basement show an unfinished area that could have walls added to make a room. In this area, you will see a rough- in for a bathroom including a toilet, sink and corner shower.
