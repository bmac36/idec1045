This is a good rod to use if the drape is mostly closed or hidden under a valance or cornice.  It is versatile as it can be hung on a wall or ceiling and is sold by the foot.  Most installers carry I beam that they can cut to the appropriate length when installing. It is also useful if you have a treatment that needs a curve as it can be bent to go around corners or curves in the window. An I beam usually is hung about 1&quot; from the ceiling so the treatment has room to slide without touching the ceiling. </p>\n                <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n                  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n                    <figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/i_beam.jpg\" alt=\" \" class=\"img-responsive center-block\">\n                      <figcaption>An example of an I-Beam rod showing curtains being hung<br>\n                        <cite>&copy; iStock.com/Art-Of-Photo</cite></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                  </div>\n                </div>",

It has velcro attached to the edges that allow a swag or flat treatment, such as a roman valance or shade, to be attached. They can be made in any size and can be placed on a ceiling or wall using &quot;L&quot; brakets. This is a great applicaton that allows the treatment to be easily removed for clieaning. Some heavy swag treatments may be stapled to the board if they are too heavy for the velcro.</p>\n                <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n                  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n                    <figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/velcro_board1.jpg\" alt=\" \" class=\"img-responsive center-block\">\n                      <figcaption>This photo shows an example of a Velcro board<br>\n                        <cite>&copy; Linda Guthro</cite></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n                  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n                    <figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/velcro_board2.jpg\" alt=\" \" class=\"img-responsive center-block\">\n                      <figcaption>This photo shows an example of a Velcro board<br>\n                        <cite>&copy; Linda Guthro</cite></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n <p>Velcro boards can also be used to hang multiple treatments such as a tailored valance, side panels and sheers by attaching three I-Beam rods to the velcro board.</p>\n                <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n                  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n                    <figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/velcro_board3.jpg\" alt=\" \" class=\"img-responsive center-block\">\n                      <figcaption>This photo shows an example of a Velcro board with i-beam rods attached<br>\n                        <cite>&copy; Linda Guthro</cite></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                  </div>",
