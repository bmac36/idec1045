        <p>Linings come in several fiber types from synthetic to natural and blended. They also come in several qualities from light weight to heavy weight, however, they are still lighter weight than the decorating face fabric. A good lining can make an inexpensive and flimsy fabric look rich, while a poor lining can ruin the effect of a high end fabric so always make sure you use a good quality lining to get the best results. </p>
        <h2>Different Lining Types</h2>
        <p>There are two differently types of linings: Commercial and Residential.</p>
        <h3>Commercial Lining</h3>
        <p><strong>Commercial lining</strong> must be used for hotels, businesses and hospitals.  The lining must meet certain criteria such as flame retardants.  There are special linings for these purposes, however we will only be learning about residential linings in this course.</p>
        <h3>Residential Lining</h3>
        <p><strong>Residential lining</strong> is what is typically used for homes.  It is usually uncoated goods that offers water repellency, insulation value, stain resistance and ultraviolet inhibitors.   It can range from 100% cotton to polyester/cotton blend, to 100% polyester.  Some rayon and acetate linings are treated for flame resistance.  Many can also come with a layer of foam acrylic for additional insulation.  Medium weight linings can be used for any fabric weight in general. </p>
        <p>Linings will come in glossy or matte finish which is a personal choice and in white or off white colouring.</p>
        <p>Some of these linings will be described in more detail below. </p>

                <p>Blackout lining is a special kind of lining to improve light control coming into a room.  There are levels of blackout from what is called dim out which blocks most of the light to full blackout which blocks almost all light.  Some use an acrylic foam coating for improved insulation and noise control.  While regular lining will block out about 50% of light, a full blackout will block about 95% of light coming into a room when the treatment is closed.</p>
                <p>Some of these linings also are treated to repel water and prevent staining.  The added insulation is good for older homes or cold climates and can be a cost savings on utilities.</p>
                <p>Blackout lining is good for bedrooms where small children take day time naps and for shift workers who sleep during the day while others need total darkness to sleep at night as well and so blackout lining will help with this need.</p>
                <p>Some blackout linings can be very stiff and heavy and do not drape well so it is important to choose one that is soft for better pleating and hang effects.  I use ones that are called 2 or 3 (layers) pass blackout linings which have a thin layer of black fabric between white and are very soft to the touch and drape well. </p>

                <p>Interlining is a kind of lining that is placed between the regular lining and the face fabric meaning that there are two kinds of lining on a treatment.  The content is almost always cotton and looks like a light weight flannel.  This kind of lining reduces sound, is a good insulator and blocks light from shining through a fabric.  In a previous lesson I mentioned that silk will rot easily when exposed to sunlight.  An interlining or a blackout lining is needed with this fabric to protect it from the sun to avoid the fabric from rotting.  Interlining is also used to give body to a treatment and allows the drape of a fabric to be softer.  I personally love using interlining to give a full and rich look to a treatment.  I always use an interlining for a valance or shade to give the fabric more support and body.  It is amazing the difference an interlining can make to the treatment and produce a very professional appearance.</p>
                <p><strong>Bump cloth</strong> is an English interlining that is heavier than a standard interlining. </p>

                <p>A thermal lining is one that has a layer of foam attached to the back of the face fabric.  It helps to keep the room warm in winter and cool in summer.  It helps the “R” value of windows by creating an air pocket between the window and the treatment that allows heating and air conditioning to be more efficient.  It can also give some ultraviolet resistance to the fabric.</p>

                <p>Most linings are not intended to be an obvious decorative feature and are not seen inside the room but only seen from the outside of the home.  A discreet lining is when the reverse side of a drape or other treatment is folded back so that one sees the back of the drape in a matching or coordinating fabric to the face fabric.  This fabric is not a real lining but an actual fabric that is visible in the room.  This treatment requires an interlining to give body and some light protection to the face fabric, however be aware that the discreet fabric used for a visible lining will fade and be affected by the sunlight hitting it.</p>
