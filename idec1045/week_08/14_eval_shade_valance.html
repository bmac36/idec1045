        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Outline current fabric trends including pattern, texture and styles as well as uses and benefits of linings to create quality window treatments for various uses</li>
          <li>Calculate both hard and soft treatments to custom order from a manufacturer or seamstress based on appropriate measurements to complete a window treatment order for a client</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment gives the student practice to calculate and plan valances and shades that they will also apply in the mid-term, exam and final project for this course.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use one page of graph paper for each window</li>
          <li>Draw the window as your working copy in &frac12; inch scale</li>
          <li>Calculate the scenarios listed below, explaining in detail how you came to each amount step by step.</li>
          <li>All trim is 3 inches wide around the window measurements given below.</li>
          <li>Label each page by the question number.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="row no-padding">

              <h3 class="top-padding">Scenarios:</h3>
              <ol class="box-number">
                <li>Calculate the fabric, interlining and lining required for a flat roman shade.  It is an inside mount on a window that is 48 inches wide and 60 inches long.  Plain fabric hung on a Velcro board.</li>
                <li>Calculate the fabric required for an outside mount mock roman valance that has 3 folds.  The treatment is hung 6 inches above the trim and covers the top of the window glass by 4 inches.  The treatment goes past the window trim by 4 inches on each side and has 4 inch returns.  The window is 70 inches wide by 70 inches long.</li>
                <li>Calculate the fabric, interlining and lining required for a flat roller shade, outside mount hung 4 inches above the upper trim and covering 2 inches below the bottom trim when closed.  It is hung 2 inches past the sides of the trim width.  The fabric has a 20 inch pattern repeat.  The window glass is 75 inches wide and 72 inches long.</li>
                <li>Calculate the fabric interlining and lining required for a box pleat valance, outside mount that is past the trim by 8 inches in each side with 4 inch returns. There are 4 full pleats across the window and &frac12; pleats at the corners.  There is a 16 inch pattern repeat.  The valance is hung at the ceiling height on a ceiling is 10 inches above the window trim and the valance covers 4 inches of the window glass.  The window is 72 inches wide and 65 inches long.</li>
