          <strong>Value of assignment:</strong> 40% of your final grade<br />
          <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Final Project Rubric</p>
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Outline the basic natural and synthetic process and uses in fabrics today</li>
          <li>Evaluate fabric construction that include weaves, yarns and durability for various treatment need</li>
          <li>Explain fabric and drapery terminology, dye lot differences, pattern repeat, railroading and common care codes for cleaning and maintaining materials.</li>
          <li>Outline current fabric trends including pattern, texture and styles as wells as uses and benefits of linings to create quality window treatments for various uses</li>
          <li>Calculate both hard and soft treatments to custom order from a manufacturer or seamstress based on appropriate measurements to complete a window treatment order for a client.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is the final project and you should be working on it throughout the semester.  It is a culmination of all information given in the lessons throughout the semester and becomes part of your professional portfolio.</p>
        <p>This project allows you to use everything you have learned throughout the semester and put it into a scenario of a client’s home.  You must take into account the room requirements for privacy, light control, style and fabric content that would best work for the client.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>As a designer, you must create 2 design boards showing elevations of window treatments for a kitchen, living room, 3 bedrooms and a master bathroom.  Fabric samples used for each window to be placed with the elevations.  A minimum 2 page essay describing in detail why you chose each fabric, lining, hardware and style along with a colour scheme for the home to be included. Include detailed calculations &ndash; in addition to the 2 page essay &ndash; of each window treatment, showing the finished size of treatment and amount of material needed to order to make each treatment. Fabric content and cleaning codes to be included in the essay portion.  Student to submit clear photos of their design boards as well as a short 5 minute or less video presenting their project, explaining their selections and the style that suits the client they have chosen.</p>
