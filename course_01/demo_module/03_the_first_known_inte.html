              <p>The first person to call herself an “Interior Decorator” was Elsie DeWolfe circa 1859 – 1950</p>
              <p>Early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century she took the current Victorian design and altered it to more individual tastes. She often would lighten all the wood in a room with paint to take away from the heavy feeling of a Victorian room. She used
                furniture from various countries in her designs.</p>
              <p>She hired trades to paint or wall paper rooms, added accessories etc. to create a more individual look. She referred to her wealthy clients as “Ladies of Good taste” and wrote a book called “House of Good Taste” in 1913. This book is all
                about the Principles and Elements of design. The average person could not afford to hire a decorator and were not exposed to this new kind of decorating. At this time only wealthy people could afford a decorator and it was a high end industry.
                For many decades, hiring a professional decorator was only for the wealthy and not the average home. </p>
              <p>Overall, good design has not changed. Style and colour trends change but good design is still the same Principles and Elements that we will learn in detail next week. </p>
