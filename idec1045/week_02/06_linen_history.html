                           <p class="tp6-p"> Linen is made from flax which is a tall, reed-like plant that grows similar to wheat.  It is a temperamental plant to grow and the quality of the linen depends on the quality of the plant flax fibers found in the stalk. This is an expensive fabric to manufacture.</p>

							<h3>Where is Flax grown?</h3>
							<p>Flax is grown in many parts of the world with the top quality coming from Western Europe though recently the bulk of linen has moved to Eastern Europe and China.  High quality linens are famously known from Ireland, Italy, and Belgium. </p>
               <h3>Early History</h3>
							<p>Linen was one of the earliest fibers made into string and cloth.  Many centuries ago almost every family grew flax that they wove to linen for their own use.  Some of the earliest established linen industry records date back 4,000 years ago from Egypt.</p>

							<p>  Linen was being spun and woven 5,000 years B.C. even before wool.  The Egyptians used linen for burial shrouds, and for centuries linen was used for table cloths, bed coverings and clothing.  </p>
        <p>In the first millennium B.C., the Egyptians mostly wore linen while the Greeks, Western Asians and Germans mostly wore wool.  By the Roman period, many wore linen tunics for comfort with wool robes over them for warmth. This trend continued to be common and eventually &quot;linen&quot; got to mean something like &quot;underwear&quot;.  Our word &quot;lingerie&quot; is related to linen.</p>
