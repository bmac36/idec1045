        <p class="top-padding">A window treatment does not have to be just one fabric.  Using more than one fabric in the same treatment can make for a more interesting finished look in some cases.  Many patterns can work well together. </p>
        <p>Did you know you can use two florals together?  Well it is true!  When mixing florals you just need to keep in mind that the florals need to be different scales.  If one floral is about the size of your fist, you can select another floral that is much smaller or much larger than that one to mix together.</p>
        <p>Geometrics can be mixed with most florals easily as long as they relate in colour, texture and style.  For example a stripe can be mixed with almost any other pattern.  A plaid can add a great pattern to a plain or print. </p>
        <p>You likely have seen many treatments that have 2 solid colours together, often on the bottom of a treatment or down the sides.  This is a great way to add length to a treatment you already have.  Check out some window treatment books to get ideas of how you can combine fabric patterns to make a one of a kind look for a window.  The options offer endless ideas to make a treatment unique and interesting.  Think of adding a band of a different pattern or colour to a treatment, as shown in the examples below:</p>
