											<p>With what you have learned about valances and soft shades, you now have a large repertoire of styles to select added to what we have covered in previous weeks from which you can choose.  There are many books you can find that have great window ideas that can be used for inspiration. One that is a must is &quot;The Encyclopedia of Window Fashions&quot; by Charles T. Randall.  The newer editions have black and white line drawings that cover all major trends and ideas for every style.  It is a great reference that should be added to your library.</p>
											<p>While we cover many styles and kinds of treatments, you will not be tested on all of them.  You will need to know how to calculate pleated drape/valances, box pleat valances and roman valances/shades for sure.</p>
											<p>Instead of practice work this week, you have an assignment that is due the last day of this week.  Make sure to give yourself enough time to complete it.  Refer to the lessons to help you calculate the answers. </p>
