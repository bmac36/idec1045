      "AnswerText": "<p>Draw Â½\" scale drawing on graph paper as your working copy.</p> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Inside mount means that the treatment sits inside the trim measure.</li> \n <li>Window width =  60\" window inside mount.</li> \n <li>Finished width needed will be the size of the window as seamstress will automatically deduct &frac18;\" on each side to allow for movement in the window. Make sure to order by the narrowest width of the window measure.</li> \n <li><strong>Finished width = 60\"</strong>.</li> \n <li>60\" window + 6\" selvage = (as valance is sewn together as one panel) width of fabric to make this treatment = <strong>66\" in total</strong> needed to order.</li> \n <li>Since fabric is 54\" wide, you need to see how many cuts of 54\" fabric you need to allow for 66\" of width.</li> \n <li>66\" divided by 54\" = 1.2 cuts. Round up to the next full cut size = <strong>2 cuts</strong> of 54\" fabric to sew together to make the width needed for this treatment.</li> \n <li>The 54\" piece will be used in the middle and the extra width will be added to each side to keep the seams unobtrusive on the treatment.</li> \n </ol> \n <p><img src=\"img/mock_roman_solution.jpg\" alt=\" This is the drawing for the solution to the mock roman valance inside mount width portion of the question\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\"></p> \n <h3>Length</h3> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Hung inside mount inside the trim.</li> \n <li><strong>Finished treatment to be 18\" in length.</strong></li> \n <li>This is not the amount to order.</li> \n <li>Mock roman style <strong>needs 12\" to make hem and header</strong>.</li> \n <li>18\" finished length + 12\" hem and header = 30\".</li>\n <li>The pattern repeat of 10\" needs to be added to the length: 30\" + 10\" pattern repeat = 40\".</li> \n <li>To make a mock roman, the fabric needs to be folded <strong>16\" for each fold of the fabric</strong> length.</li> \n <li>40\" + 16\" fold + 16\" fold + 16\" fold = 88\" length to order.</li> \n <li>We need 2 cuts of fabric to make this treatment, so 88\" length x 2 cuts = 176\" of fabric to order / 36\" = 4.8 yards of fabric. Round up to <strong> 5 or 5 &frac14; yards to order</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Lining:</strong> Do not include pattern repeat for any lining. Since there is a 10\" pattern repeat, order 88\" - 10\" repeat = 78\" x 2 cuts = 156\" / 36\" = 4.3 yards of lining and interlining each. Round up to 4 &frac12; yards.</li> \n <li>An interlining is a recommended option to give more body to the folds and give a more custom look to the treatment. Interlining would be 4 &frac12; yards.</li> \n </ol> ",
