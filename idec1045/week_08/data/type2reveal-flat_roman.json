      "AnswerText": "<p>Draw ½\" scale drawing on graph paper as your working copy.</p> \n <h3>Width:</h3> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Inside mount means that the treatment sits inside the trim measure.</li> \n <li>Window width = 60\" window inside mount on a Velcro board.</li> \n <li>Finished width needed will be the size of the window as seamstress will automatically deduct &frac18;\" on each side to allow for movement in the window. Make sure to order by the narrowest width of the window measure.</li> \n <li><strong>Finished width = 60\"</strong>.</li> \n <li>60\" window + 6\" selvage = (as valance is sewn together as one panel) width of fabric to make this treatment = <strong>66\" in total</strong> needed to order.</li> \n <li>Since fabric is 65\" wide, you need to see how many cuts of 54\" fabric you need to allow for 66\" of width.</li> \n <li>66\" / 54\" = 1.2 cuts. Round up to the next full cut size = <strong> 2 cuts</strong> of 54\" fabric to sew together to make the width needed for this treatment.</li> \n <li>The 65\" piece will be used in the middle and the extra width will be added to each side to keep the seams unobtrusive on the treatment.</li>  \n </ol> \n <p><img src=\"img/flat_roman_solution.jpg\" alt=\" This is the drawing for the solution to the flat roman inside mount width portion of the question\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\"></p> \n <h3>Length</h3> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Since inside mount measure the length of the window and use the longest measure.</li> \n <li>Length = 48\" long</li> \n <li>This is not the amount to order. Flat roman shade style needs 12\" to make hem and header.</li> \n <li>48\" finished length + 12\" hem and header = 60\".</li> \n <li>Have a pattern repeat of 15\" that needs to be added to the length:  60\" + 15\" pattern repeat = 75\".</li> \n <li>We need 2 cuts of fabric to make this treatment: 75\" length X 2 cuts = 150\" of fabric to order / 36\" = 4.16 yards of fabric.  Round up to 4 ½ to 4 ¾ yards to order.</li> \n <li><strong>Lining:</strong>  Do not include pattern repeat for any lining.  Since there is a 15\" pattern repeat, order 75\" – 15\" repeat = 60\" x 2 cuts = 120\" / 36\" = 3.3 yards of lining and interlining each.  Round up to 3 ½ yards.</li> \n <li>An interlining is a recommended option to give more body to the folds and give a more custom look to the treatment.  Interlining would be 3 ½ yards.</li>  \n </ol> ",
