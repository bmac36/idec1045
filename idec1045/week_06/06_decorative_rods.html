      <p>Decorative rods can range from simple wood poles and brackets to elaborate metals of all colours.  The decorative rod is visible and an important element to the end result and impression of a window treatment.  This kind of hardware shows the drape suspended below a visible rod and is used for many styles of drapery and valances. </p>
      <p> Decorative rods add texture and colour and come in a variety of wood and metal finishes and in diameters from 1 &ndash; 3 inches.  Longer lengths are held together by a splice and can be cut to the correct size upon installation.  Solid rods are recommended over  expandable ones  to make sure the rod is the same diameter across the entire length for a more finished look. The wider the window the larger the diameter of the rod should be. </p>
      <p>Large rooms, or those with a higher ceiling, should always use a large rod to match the proportions of the room.  Since the rod is decorative and part of the window treatment design, it is important to have it large enough to show well in a room.  Decorative rods are usually sold separately so that you can select the bracket (to hang the rod), ring (to attach the treatment) and finial (the decorative end piece on the rod) of choice.  These threatments manually open by pulling the drape or using a small rod hanging down from the decorative rod.</p>
