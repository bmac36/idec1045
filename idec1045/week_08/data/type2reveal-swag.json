      "AnswerText": "<p>Draw Â½\" scale drawing on graph paper as your working copy.</p> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Outside mount means the valance has to come past the side width by 2\" on each side.</li> \n <li>Window width = 3\" return + 2\" past + 6\" trim + 18\" swag + 18\" swag + 18\" swag + 6\" trim + 2\" past + 3\" return = 76\" of space needed.</li> \n <li>Finished width needed <strong>does not include returns</strong> because they go back from the front of the treatment. Finished width = 2\" past + 6\" trim + 18\" swag + 18\" swag + 18\" swag + 6\" trim + 2\" past = <strong>finished width of treatment 70\" </strong>.</li> \n <li>Since the swag is railroaded the 54\" width becomes the length of the swag and so no more calculations are needed for the width. We know each swag takes up 18\" in width.</li> \n </ol> \n <p><img src=\"img/swag_jabot_solution.jpg\" alt=\" This is the drawing for the solution to the swag and Jabot outside mount width portion of the question\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\"></p> \n <h3>Length</h3> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Hung 4\" above the trim: 18\" from glass to ceiling - 6\" trim = 12\" of wall space.</li> \n <li>Hang 4\" above trim = 12\" wall space - 4\" above to hang = 8\" left to ceiling. Therefore hang 8\" below ceiling.</li> \n <li>Swag is railroaded so that each 18\" swag needs 1 &frac12; yards.</li> \n <li>Multiply 1 &frac12; yards x 3 swags = <strong>4.5 yards for swags</strong>.</li> \n <li>Jabots are finished half way down the window = 4\" above trim + 6\" trim + 24\" for half length of window = <strong>34\" finished length</strong> + 10\" hem and header = 44\" needed for each jabot x 2 jabots - 88\" divided by 36\" in a yard = 2.44 yards.</li> \n <li>Add swag yardage of 4.5 + jabot yards of 2.44 yards = 6.94 yards total. Round up to <strong>7 yards to order</strong>.</li> \n <li>Since there is no pattern, order the same amount of lining. Linings can be discrete for this style often because it shows in the folds of the jabots. The lining that shows would be the same yardage as the Jabot and you can use reular lining for the swag.</li> \n </ol> \n ",
