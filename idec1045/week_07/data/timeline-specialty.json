Since there is not a lot of frame allowance around a French door and has a handle you need to make sure the treatment you select will fit.  You will need 2 to 3 ½” to mount brackets above the window.  You can also add hold-down brackets 2” below the window to keep the blind in place when opening and closing to the outside.  The blind will need to fall just inside the latch or slip between the handle and the door to allow free access to operate the handle.  When in doubt of the fit for the treatment you are using, get a check measure from your installer before you order the treatment.</p>\n                <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n                  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n                    <figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/french_doors.jpg\" alt=\" \" class=\"img-responsive center-block\">\n                      <figcaption>An example of a french doors.<br>\n                        <cite>© iStock.com/hikesterson</cite></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                  </div>\n                </div>",
