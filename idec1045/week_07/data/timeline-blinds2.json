Wood comes in stain finishes from light to dark as well as whites and in some cases can be custom coloured for an extra fee.</p>  <p class=\"bottom-space\">This kind of blind is very attractive in a window and can be opened or closed by the slats or raised up and down by cords. The blind slats are held together with cords or band attachments. These blinds can get very heavy to raise when used on Patio doors or large windows.</p>\n                <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n                  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n                    <figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/wooden_blinds.jpg\" alt=\" \" class=\"img-responsive center-block\">\n                      <figcaption>This photo shows what wooden blinds look like<br>\n                        <cite>© iStock.com/studiocasper</cite></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                  </div>\n                </div>",

They can be custom made in a variety of colours, however I only order them in neutral whites or metallic.  The metallic like gold, silver and copper are very attractive and modern looking and the whites are versatile when changing colours in a room.  These blinds come in 1inch called mini blinds and &frac12; inch called micro mini blinds.    They can come wider now as well in 2 inch blinds and are offered in many finishes. Metal blinds are relatively inexpensive compared to some other kinds of blinds and are good great choices for budget conscious selections.  They also provide a great deal of light when the slats are opened.</p>\n                <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n                  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n                    <figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/metal_blinds.jpg\" alt=\" \" class=\"img-responsive center-block\">\n                      <figcaption>An example of a metal blinds.<br>\n                        <cite>© iStock.com/Bibica</cite></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                  </div>\n                </div>",

It is also possible to get a blackout lining installed, however all backs of blinds facing the exterior of the window usually are a neutral white or ivory backing in good quality makes.</p>  <p>Pleated blinds usually operate on cords, however some  manufacturers also offer some cordless styles.  Pleated blinds stack up very small and can be mounted to be almost invisible on a window when wanting a very open look in a room. These blinds are available in a regular operating style where the blind when down covers the entire window or in a \"top/down\" fashion when the blinds can be closed on the bottom and open on the top to any level desired. This top/down use is great to provide privacy on the bottom level while allowing light coming into the room from the top.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Many master bathrooms today have large almost picture-size windows and often in front of the tub. I use these blinds with the top/down style on those windows for privacy. Not one wants to be visible from the outside when climbing into the tub!</p> <p class=\"bottom-padding\">Available in horizontal up/down style or now vertical (left/right) operation, they are an excellent choice when the user wants a treatment to give privacy yet take up very little stacking when fully open. The blinds are made of various fabrics that can be easily spot cleaned and can be professionally cleaned by checking with dealers in your area if necessary.</p>\n                <div class=\"row bottom-space\">\n                  <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-offset-1\">\n                    <figure class=\"cap-bot\"> <img src=\"img/pleated_blinds.jpg\" alt=\" \" class=\"img-responsive center-block\">\n                      <figcaption>This photo shows an example of a pleated blinds<br>\n                        <cite>© iStock.com/yenwen</cite></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n          <div class=\"callout top-space\"> \n             <div class=\"col-sm-2 no-padding text-center top-space\"> <i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-facetime-video glyphicon-3x accent-one-font\"></i> </div> \n          <div class=\"col-sm-10\"> \n               <h2>Video</h2> \n           <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aD-08gO3gaQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> \n             </div> \n  <div class=\"clearfix\"></div>  \n  <p class=\"top-space\"><a href=\"http://www.thebauhaus.ca/\" title=\"link to Bauhaus Window Coverings and Draperies\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"../../assets/img/bauhaus 300dpi.jpg\" width=\"20%\" class=\"img-responsive pull-right right-padding\" alt=\"Bauhaus Window Coverings and Draperies Logo\" /></a></p> \n             ",
