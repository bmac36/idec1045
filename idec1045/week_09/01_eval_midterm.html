        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain fabric and drapery terminology, dye  lot differences, pattern repeat, railroading and common care codes for cleaning and maintaining materials.</li>
          <li>Outline current fabric trends including pattern, texture and styles as well as uses and benefits of linings to create quality window treatments for various uses.</li>
          <li>Calculate both hard and soft treatments to custom order from a manufacturer or seamstress based on appropriate measurements to complete a window treatment order for a client.</li>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This mid-term is a culmination of all lessons to date where you must decide on a client and design window treatments to suit the client and their style. You are required to calculate all forms of window treatments from stationary to functional drapes, hard treatment, valances and shades. This is excellent review and practice to make sure you understand how to calculate various treatments before the exam and final project are due.</p>

          <li>On a separate page for each window, draw out the window to &frac12; inch scale on graph paper in pencil, showing a brief sketch of the treatment used</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="well">
          <h3>Create window treatments for 5 window areas</h3>
