                                <p>This circle is also called curve and can often be seen in nature like clouds, sun, deciduous trees, logs, flowers, stones and our bodies. It also includes spheres, cones and cylinders. This shape and form suggests constantly living like a rolling stone, waves in the ocean. This shape/form is increasing in today’s architecture and used in circular staircases, curved walls, windows, pillars, and dome ceilings. Many items of the home have this shape…plates, bowls, lampshades, pillows, some tables and chairs</p>
                                <p>It is a natural focal point when accented and is a basic motif for textiles, wallpaper and carpeting.</p>

                            <p>A triangle/angular shape is sometimes found in nature like mountains, evergreen trees. The pyramids in Egypt are examples of a triangular form. This shape and form is dynamic with its pointed ends and implies motion which can be used to hold attention. It can increase the apparent size of a space. It is also versatile as the angles can change like folding legs on a chair.</p>

                            <p>Squares and rectangles are rarely found in nature. Have you ever seen a square flower, mountain, or lake?</p>
                            <p>However Rectilinear is the most popular shape and form in buildings and interior spaces. It is an easy shape/form to pack and handle. It is 90 degree angles that give a sense of stability and strength. Think of bricks of a home.</p>
                            <p>Most buildings are this shape, windows, furniture, most rooms. It can also be seen in smaller uses like a plaid pattern on fabric.</p>
                            <p>Rectilinear shapes and forms give unity and rhythm when repeated, however too much of this can be boxlike and monotonous.</p>
                            <p>We expect to see this shape or form in a room as a stabilizer.</p>
