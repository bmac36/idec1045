                           <h3>The Story</h3>
                           <p>There was a student who purchased ready-made silk drapery at a store in Toronto for $800/pair.  They had a lining, but it was very poor quality.  He asked if they could be replaced with a lining that would protect his silk from the sun.  This meant that the entire treatment would have to be re-made custom for him.</p>
                           <p> It ended up costing him more to do the proper lining on the ready-made drapery than if he had purchased them custom to begin with.  This was a real eye opener for him as he thought custom would be much more costly than ready-made, a mistake, I am sure, many of us could easily make.</p>

                           <!--Main - Right Col-->
                       <div class="col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-0 col-md-5 col-md-offset-0 col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-0">
                          
                           <h3>What You Can Learn from This</h3>
												 <p>While you can certainly purchase a drapery panel for a beginning price of around $20-$50 ready-made, it does not mean that all ready-made treatments are always less expensive.  Be aware when shopping and do your research.</p>
												 <p>One thing to keep in mindâ€¦your level of drapery should match the level of custom you have in your home.  If you have invested in good quality furniture that will last you for a long time, then you should do the same for your window treatments.  When comparing the look between a ready-made and custom made treatment there is a vast difference in the look, feel and quality that makes the investment worthwhile. </p>

								 <h3>Something to think about</h3>
								 <p>I mentioned earlier that the trend is to hang high for drapery and this is also a practical idea as well.  If you hang your drapery from ceiling to floor or high above the window trim, it means that the treatment you invested in will adapt to a new residence more easily and not just fit the window it is on now.  Windows all have varying heights but walls are rather standard, so if you fit your treatment to the wall size, you have more room to work with if you move and can take your investment treatment with you. </p>
