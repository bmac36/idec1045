                           <h3>What is a Stationary Treatment?</h3>
													<p>A stationary treatment is one that is decorative and does not move.  It is a single panel or pair of panels that sits at the sides of a window, often covering more wall than actual window. The amount of fabric for a stationary panel should be proportionate to the window width &mdash; the wider the window, the wider the side panels should be.  When hanging a pleated panel, allow 1 &ndash; 2 inches of fabric width so that the fabric relaxes without being stretched on the rod.</p>
													<h3>Measuring 101</h3>
													<p>For all of our pleated measurements, we will assume a 54 inch wide fabric for our calculations.  This is the width of the fabric from one selvage edge to the other when lying flat. Always check the fabric you are using for the actual fabric width as they can vary.</p>
													<p><strong>1x width</strong>,  or a single width panel, needs to be pleated to create fullness at 2.5 times the fullness. This means that we have to scrunch up that single width to create pleats. To do this, you need to fold in the salvage edges to create a neat hem and hide the selvage. This is done by folding in the selvage sides 3 inches on each side of the fabric for a total of 6 inches altogether.  </p>
													<p>Therefore a 54 inch fabric minus 6 inches to finish the selvage edges equals 48 inches of finished fabric divided by 2.5 for the fullness amount which equals 19.2 inches of pleated fabric. Since we need to allow the fabric to &quot;relax&quot; while hanging, you would get a panel that is 18 inches in width to hang.</p>

                           <!--Main - Right Col-->
                       <div class="col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-0 col-md-5 col-md-offset-0 col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-0">
                          
													<h3>Need a Fuller Panel?</h3>
													<p>If you need a fuller panel for a wider window, you could use larger widths:</p>
													<p><strong>1.5 widths</strong> equals one 54 inch piece of fabric and half of that width again, which is 27 inches, sewn together. This equals 81 inches of fabric minus 6 inches selvage edge which equals 75 inches in total. Divide this total by 2.5 inch fullness  and that equals 30 inches taut or 29 inches relaxed.  1.5 widths requires three 54 inch pieces of fabric, which we call cuts, to make 1.5 for each side of the window.  </p>

                    <figcaption>Notice that there are three cuts of fabric and one is cut in half and will be attached to the full cut to make 1.5 panel width for each side of the window.<br />

													<h3>Two Times Width</h3>
												 <p><strong>2x width</strong> is equal to two 54 inch pieces of fabric sewn together to make a single 108 inch piece less the 6 inch selvage for a total width of 102 inches. Divide this by  2.5 times fullness and this equals 40.8 inches taut fabric pleated or about 38 &ndash; 39 inches relaxed.  Two 54 inch pieces of fabric are needed for double width, making the total pieces of 54 inch fabric four to do both panels.</p>
