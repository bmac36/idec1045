                    <p>Well educated people created more interest in decorating their homes to reflect their individual tastes. With this, from the 80’s on there has been a huge growth in décor due to the baby boomers who were well educated, travelled and became more sophisticated. They wanted to make their home reflect their interests, lifestyle and status.</p>
                    <p>Our home construction changed as well to smaller lots (40 feet wide) with homes becoming taller to fit all the rooms needed. Townhouses are becoming extremely popular as are condos for those working and who have no time or desire to do outside home maintenance. </p>

                                        <p>Kitchens that have a large eating area and are open to a family room. This allows for conversation with family and company. Kitchens are the hub of the home now and not just a utility area that is closed off from the rest of the house. They are often the most expensive part of the home with high end appliances, cabinets finished like fine furniture and islands that are a gathering place. In larger kitchens there is room for multiple cooks preparing the meal. The rise in cooking shows on TV expresses this growing interest. It has become a family affair and not just for one person to prepare away from others. Some kitchens are also multi-purpose with spaces for desks and computer or coffee bar areas, and wine storage.</p>

                                        <p>Bathrooms are elegant spaces now that can have a spa and relaxing feeling. Most homes have more than one bathroom. En-suite bathrooms are often the largest bath in the home with high end showers, vanities that look like high end furniture and in some cases room for seating. Some bathrooms even have a fireplace or TV. For many families, the main bathroom near the bedrooms is for the children of the home that caters to their growing needs. Powder rooms are common for public use and are handy to the main living spaces of the home.</p>
                                        <p>Even laundry rooms are moving up from the basement to the ground floor and often the second floor near the bedrooms.</p>
