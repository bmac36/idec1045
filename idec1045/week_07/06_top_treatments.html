 													<p>Top treatments featured this week are the hard kind made from wood or metal and are not as common to use but can be an interesting addition to a window treatment.  Top treatments using soft fabrics are called valances which will be covered in next week’s lesson.</p>
													<p>Hard top treatments are not generally used on their own but with drapery or blinds.  They add an architectural feature to a window and can be upholstered in a soft fabric or made from wood that can be stained or painted to suit the décor of the room.  In some cases metal can also be used to create them as well.  </p>
													<p>In the reading this week, you can see drawing examples of a Cornice, Lambrequin and Cantonniere</p>

                           <h3>Cornice</h3>
                           <p>A cornice is like a valance covering the top of the window.  It can be made in numerous shapes or square and mostly made from wood that is painted or stained.   </p>

                       </div>
                       
                       
                           <!--Main - Right Col-->
                       <div class="col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-0 col-md-5 col-md-offset-0 col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-0">
												 <p>A cornice can act as a feature to draw the eye upward to the top of the window.  It is made to cover the top of the treatment hardware and sticks out from the wall about 4-6” allowing the treatment underneath to operate smoothly.</p>
                           <h3>Lambrequin</h3>
                           <p>A lambrequin is much like a cornice, however the sides come partway down the sides of the window.  These can be made from wood or even metal and painted or stained.  They project out from the wall about 4-6” to allow the treatment underneath to operate smoothly.  </p>
												 <h3>Cantonniere</h3>
												 <p>A Cantonniere is a structure surrounding the top and sides of a window frame and extending to the floor.  They are flush to the wall creating a shape around the window and can be made from wood or metal and painted or stained.  This style is not often used yet can create an interesting theme or frame and would look good with a hard treatment as an inside mount on the window.</p>
