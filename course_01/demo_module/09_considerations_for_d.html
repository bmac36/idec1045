              <p>Decorating is a science and business in addition to creativity. A good decorator is knowledgeable in all these areas and this is where being properly educated in this field will be invaluable to you.</p>
              <p>I have found that many people only look at the creative side of decorating and think it is just fun and they can do what they want in any room. While there certainly is an important creative side, there are rules to follow to create a well
                decorated room. To be successful you must also be a good business person. You need to have a business plan to make valuable use of your time, costs and make a profit in the end. Working with clients is a very personal thing and so you
                need to be a good listener to hear what your client is asking for. It can be a very emotional time for a client to make major decisions about their home. You may have to be sensitive to the psychological impact decorating can be for some
                people. A good decorator will be able to build an important level of trust with a client so that they can rely on you to help make all the decisions for them and guide them to a happy ending and a beautiful home. As a result, you need
                to be able to appreciate all styles, colour schemes and lifestyles. It is important to not just decorate in one’s own taste but to adapt to the client desires and needs.</p>
