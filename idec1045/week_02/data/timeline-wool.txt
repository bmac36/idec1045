To wash the wool it is swished back and forth with wooden forks that beat it before it goes to rollers that pass from one tank to another.  In the end it is beaten into a fluffy mass which his squeezed out.  Some of the oil is put back to make it more manageable.</p>",

It is smoother than and not as bulky as woolen wool.  Worsted wool is arranged parallel using longer yarn.  Worsted wool is more durable and costly than woolens.
