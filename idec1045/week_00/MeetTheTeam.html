                            <h2>Bio</h2>

                            <p>Acknowledged as an authority in Interior Decorating in the post-secondary sector, I have been teaching evenings at Conestoga College since 2000.  I have developed this program which has many successful graduates thriving in this industry.  Testimonies from my students have been overwhelming and I am always pleased to hear from them about their fulfilling careers.  I have been the recipient of 2 Associate Faculty awards and the David J. Stewart Memorial Award for excellence in teaching.</p>

                            <p>My past includes a distinguished academic career as a graduate with high honours from Sheridan College of Interior Design.  My 30+ years of experience has allowed me to become expert in many areas of decorating from furniture, paint and paper, flooring, window treatments, kitchen and bath design, new home building and renovations.  I owned my own successful business and store location for many years. I have hosted countless decorating seminars and have been a keynote speaker at numerous events during my career sharing my knowledge with the public. </p>

                           <p>In my spare time I love reading, architecture, camping and cooking.  I have a young Havanese dog named Sabine (Beanie) who is my little sweetheart and constant companion.</p>
