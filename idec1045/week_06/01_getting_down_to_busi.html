                           <h3>Let's Get Started</h3>
                           <p>Now that you have been introduced to fabrics let’s get down to the business of creating a window treatment from the ground up.  We will go over how to properly measure a window, explain drapery hardware and learn to measure stationary, operating and sheer treatments as well as calculate the amount of face fabric and lining required. </p>
													<h3>Why the Decorator Needs to Know</h3>
													<p>I am sometimes asked &quot;Why do I have to know this information?  I am the decorator &ndash; I'm not making the treatment.&quot;  My answer is this:  <em>It is important to know how to measure properly for all windows as the seamstress will sew the treatment according to the decorator’s specifications and the installer will hang according to the same specifications</em>.  </p>

                       </div>
                       
                       
                           <!--Main - Right Col-->
                       <div class="col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-0 col-md-5 col-md-offset-0 col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-0">
                          
                           <h3>Who with the What Now?</h3>
												 <p>It is up to the decorator to design the style of the treatment that is suitable for the window shape, size and function.  It is also up to the decorator to select the appropriate fabric that will suit all needs and to order the correct quantity.  This means that <strong>the decorator has the most responsibility</strong> and therefore needs to have, record and keep accurate records to make sure the treatment is done properly.</p>

												 <h2>Learning Tip</h2>
												 <p>Follow along as we go and when measurements are being explained, you will learn better if you do the activity with the lesson.  We will have some practice questions also for you to do at the end that will give you practice to do this week’s assignment. </p>
