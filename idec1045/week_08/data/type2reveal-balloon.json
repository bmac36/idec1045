Round up to the next full cut size = <strong> 5 cuts</strong> of 54\" fabric to sew together to make the width needed for this treatment.</li> \n </ol> \n <p><img src=\"img/balloon_solution.jpg\" alt=\" This is the drawing for the solution to the ballooon shade outside mount width portion of the question\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\"></p> \n <h3>Length</h3> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Since outside mount measure 6\" above trim + 6\" trim + 48\" length of window + 6\" bottom trim + 2\" below trim = <strong>68\" finished length</strong>.</li> \n <li>This is not the amount to order. Balloon shade style needs 20\" added length for hem and header and soft bottom.</li> \n <li>68\" finished length + 20\" = 88\" in length to order.</li> \n <li>We need 5 cuts of fabric to make this treatment: 88\" length X 5 cuts = 440\" of fabric to order / 36\" = 12.2 yards of fabric.  Round up to <strong> 12 ½ to 12&nbsp;¾ yards to order</strong>.</li> \n <li><strong>Lining:</strong>  Same amount of lining and interlining needed to order.</li> \n <li>An interlining is a recommended option to give more body to the folds and give a more custom look to the treatment.</li>  \n </ol> ",
