They talk about not knowing where things are and being anxious to ask for directions for fear that they won’t understand the directions.  The teacher creates a large, simplified map of the neighbourhood with large pictures on the board.  She describes where different buildings are in relation to each other, using the commands “turn left” “turn right” and ”go straight”, as well as the phrases “on the left”, “on the right”, “between” and “across from” as part of her description of the neighbourhood.",
