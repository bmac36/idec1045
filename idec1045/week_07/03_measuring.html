        <p>Measuring windows for hard treatments is the same as soft treatments.  You measure top, middle and bottom of the horizontal width measure and left, middle and right of vertical length measure.  Always measure each window even if they appear to be the same size as small differences are common and will affect the treatment size.  Measure as accurately as possible to the 1/8” of an inch.  Make sure to use a metal sturdy tape measure. </p>

                <p>Inside mounts use the narrowest measure on the width and the longest measure on the length.  The narrowest measure would be used to order and deduct &frac14; inch in total &ndash; &frac18; inch on each side of the blind &ndash; from that width to allow the treatment to operate without touching the frame. </p>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some manufacturers deduct this amount automatically so check to make sure this number is not deducted already when you order. </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Measure exact size in 3 places on width, top, middle and bottom of area inside the trim of the window</li>
                  <li>Order lowest measurement of width so blind fits in smallest part of window</li>
                  <li>Measure exact size in 3 places on length, left, middle and right  of area inside the trim of the window</li>
                  <li>Record all measures on working graph paper drawing</li>
                  <li>Order by longest measure of length</li>
                  <li>Deduct &frac14; inch total from width to allow ease of operation on blind &ndash; &frac18; inch on each side will be deducted by manufacturer.  State this deduction on order form.</li>
                  <li>State what side, left or right, you want to locate the operating cord</li>

                <p>Outside mounts use the widest measure on the width and the longest measure on the length.  Add 1 &frac12; inch past the frame on each width side of the frame as some frames are not square and you want to make sure all the frame is covered by the treatment.   Add 1 &frac12; inches below the frame to make sure the frame does not show.  You can mount directly on the frame if the blind is not to be raised up and down and only opened by adjusting the slats.</p>

                <p>Wall mounts above the frame, hang a minimum of 4 inches above the frame and to 1 &frac12; inches below the bottom frame.  The amount above the frame depends on the length of the blind.  Wall mount hanging allows to hang the blind as high as needed to allow for what is called stack height.  It is the amount of wall space needed to allow the blind to open fully and be right off the window or if you want a more vertical look to the blind in the room.</p>

                  <li>To mount the blind above the frame on the wall add at least 4 inches above the frame or to the height you want the blind to hang from &ndash; between 4inches above the trim to the ceiling &ndash; and add this height to the length</li>
                  <li> Order by longest measure of length plus 1 &frac12; inches past the trim on the bottom plus the distance above the frame </li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Draw the window on graph paper in ½” scale as your working copy and file for future reference. </li>
                  <li>Measuring the wall spaces around the window are also a good idea for future reference as well.  Some windows that are close to a corner need to show that spacing to allow certain treatments to be used. </li>
                  <li>Be sure to always measure twice for accuracy. </li>
                  <li>Windows that are an odd shape, 2 story or something you are not comfortable with, get an installer to check measure for you.  The cost is worth it to be accurate and can save you expensive errors. </li>
                  <li>When measuring in a home you should also note which side you would want the operating cord to be placed on. </li>
                  <li>Many blinds can have multiple blinds on one headrail so that each section can operate independently on one window.  For example if you have a living room window with 3 sections to it, you  can have blinds made that fit each window size and have them all operate separately, giving the user the option of opening/ closing each section as desired. </li>
