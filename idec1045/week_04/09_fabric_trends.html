            <p>As with any decorating era, trends change in the window treatment industry as well.  Fabrics that are current trends reflect the contemporary style of d&eacute;cor over the past decade and influences from other parts of the world.  We get influences from what is happening in our societies, colour trends and textures that are popular as well.  The following are 10 current fabric trends that you should be able to recognize.</p>

                  <p>Natural fibers like cotton, linen and especially silk are very popular and gaining each year.  There is a strong trend to use renewable resource materials. </p>

                  <p>Grey and bronze fabric colours offer the popular urban look so evident in much of the current d&eacute;cor trends.  I am sure you have all seen the trend to these colours in stores and magazines as well as TV shows.  The grey tones are becoming very common for walls and flooring and naturally they would appear in fabrics for upholstery and window treatments as well.  These tones together have a chic appearance and work for all styles of decor.</p>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                  <p>Bold patterns often in black and white make a bold statement and are a welcome change to all the plain fabrics from the past decade.  They mix well with the contemporary look we have had.  Bold patterns make a statement and so you don’t need a lot of it in a room to draw attention.  They are a great addition to a room with no pattern and are growing in popularity to add a new focus for window treatments.  You already see this in wall paper that has large bold pattern used like art on one wall and on window treatments they can be a wonderful focal point.</p>

                  <p>Metallic used in threads within a fabric like gold, silver, bronze and copper add some sheen and interest.  That little bit of sparkle in a fabric can really add some interest to a fabric.  It doesn’t take much to add glamour to a material.  It is also fun to mix your metals in a room.  The old way of having all fixtures being the same colour has moved to a more eclectic appreciation of mixing brass, silver, copper and wrought iron in different areas of the room.  For example you may have some brass or gold on mirror frames, wrought iron on curtain rods and then some copper thread in your window treatment.  Look for fabrics with some metallic enhancement and see how a little can be exciting in a window treatment fabric.</p>

                  <p>Embroidered elements add elegance and charm to a window treatment and is a nod to the traditional style returning more over the next decade.   Often seen in silk and sheers, it can be an exciting element to a window treatment.  With the trend becoming more traditional you are bound to see embroidered fabrics increase as well in accent cushions and bedding.    Embroidered can be fabrics like crewel, eyelet and lace. </p>

                  <p>Prints of all kinds are also returning more over the next few years.  You will see more floral returning along with all other kinds of prints returning.  This is evident now in accessories and will flow into all areas of décor.  They will not be like your grandmothers era but more sophisticated and a welcome addition to your decorating portfolio. </p>

                  <p>Leather is still extremely popular and while common in furniture and headboards, they can give a very interesting addition to window treatments in upholstered cornice for a tailored look.  Some vinyl looks have a great leather texture at a lower cost.  We see a lot of leather in furniture like benches, dining chairs, club chairs and sofas and there is no reason that we cannot add some leather or faux leather to windows as well in certain structured treatments.</p>

                  <p>Textured semi sheer often has a great pattern from traditional to contemporary that can add a great look to windows such as the urban lofts with the large windows they offer as well as in any home.  The new sheers are very exciting and nothing like 20 or 30 years ago.  Today there are amazing textured sheers on the market for all styles of décor.  A semi sheer can also add more privacy than a delicate sheer will as well as soften the light coming into the room.  If you need more light control you can always add a blind underneath.  Textured sheers don’t just have to be drapery but can also come in shades and blinds as well as many patterns woven into them to create the look you are wanting to achieve. </p>
