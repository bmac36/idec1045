                        <p>Online and in-class participation is required in this course. Students are expected to contribute an original post and offer replies to your group members for each discussion topic. Your submissions will be visible only to your assigned group members (maximum of 6) and your instructor. The instructor’s role is as an observer and facilitator. This document sets out tips and tricks to make your experience with discussion boards a good one.</p>

                                        <p>Your initial submission for each discussion board is a reflection on your own experience with respect to the discussion topic. A reflection explores both what you have learned about a topic through your own experience and what your opinions are on this topic. You may also choose to explore your feelings and emotions as a part of your reflection.</p>

                                        <p>Edit your response for grammar and spelling, and post early so that others have a chance to learn from and reply to your comments. You will not be able to see your classmates’ reflections until you submit your initial post.</p>

                                        <p>Note: Always compile and save your work in a word processing program first, and then copy and paste your work into the discussion board. </p>
