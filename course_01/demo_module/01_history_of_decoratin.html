                            <p class="tp6-p">Mankind has always wanted to embellish their homes to reflect their lifestyle from cavemen painting on the cave walls to the Egyptians and other ancient societies creating elaborate décor to today with the huge interest in home décor from all income levels and societies. Man has always wanted to display things of importance to them like the animals they hunted, crops they grew. </p>

                        <p>Throughout history decorating one’s home was a window into the interests and importance of their time and often a status symbol of wealth. In the past there were no decorators. The stone mason or architect did it all from home construction to decor and furniture. There were no individual styles to select from. </p>
                        <p>Most people were not well off enough to decorate. That was saved for the wealthy. Common people furnished their homes yet could not afford to embellish or make changes. In medieval times the common person had furniture that was functional and sparse. A chair, table and bed were often the only furniture pieces. They didn’t even have glass windows but openings in the walls to allow air that were covered by cloth for weather protection. Floors could be dirt, and heated with a fireplace that was also used for cooking. </p>
