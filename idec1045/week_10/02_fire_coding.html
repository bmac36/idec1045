              <h2>Fire coding is labeled on the back of fabric when sold in books</h2>
               <h3>It's the Law</h3>
               <p>When creating treatments for commercial locations such as schools, churches, auditoriums, and theatres, the law states that the materials must be certified as flame retardant.  This is overseen by NFPA, the National Fire Prevention Association who sets the standards depending on how the fabric is to be used.  The UFAC, the Upholstered Furniture Action Council, also does testing on materials for that industry.</p>

               <h3>Where to Find the Fire Code</h3>
               <p>You can find this information on the back of all book style fabrics.  There are different codes that meet different standards.  Fabric companies also carry commercial lines that are fire retardant certified that are most often the go to area when decorating a commercial space.  We are concentrating on residential decorating in this course, however I usually try and look for a good fire code label especially for children’s rooms or areas such as kitchens where stoves and ovens are located as well as bedding.  Since fabrics come from all over the world, these two code companies are the most commonly recognized by the fabric industry standards. </p>

			 <h3>Codes and their meanings</h3>
			 <p>There are different codes relating to categories of use such as:</p>
			 <p><strong>NFPA701:</strong> flame resistance for fabrics and fibers<br />
				 <strong>NFPA260 &amp; UFAC Class 1:</strong> Upholstery fabric</p>
			 <p>To explain the meaning of these a bit further:</p>
			 <ul>
				 <li><strong>UFAC class 1</strong> is a basic test method to determine flammability performance of upholstery fabric in contact with polyurethane foam (usually the seat cushions).  Specifically to cigarette ignition resistance so that if the fabric passes is a class 1.  </li>
				 <li><strong>UFAC class 2</strong> means that the material did not meet the criteria and failed.  To pass it must be used in conjunction with a flame-retardant lining material between the textile cover and the upholstery foam.</li>
				 <li><strong>NFPA260</strong> is the test method determining resistance to cigarette ignition for materials used in upholstered furniture.  They use a small scale composite test with a smoldering cigarette to drapery, curtains and other hanging textiles to measure the flammability of a fabric when exposed to a specific source of ignition.  They rate the materials resistance after exposed to a flame for 12 seconds to measure the flame, char length and flaming residue and record the results.  If an after flame is less than 2 seconds, a char length is less than 6 ½” and does not continue to flame after reaching he floor of the test chamber it is certified as flame retardant and is certified to receive the pass code.</li>
				 <li><strong>NFPA701</strong> is a common code for fabrics for drapery.  The NFPA701 small scale code means that if a drapery fabric once exposed to a flame has no after flame under 2 seconds, no more than 6 ½” of char length and extinguishes once it reaches the test room floor.</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>If you see the fabric you are selecting shows a fire retardant code you will know they have passed the flame retardant standards.</p>
			 <p>There is a lot of information on Canadian test standards in this article: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/consumer-product-safety/reports-publications/industry-professionals/industry-guide-flammability-textile.html" title="Industry Guide to Flammability of Textile Products in Canada" target="_blank">Industry Guide to Flammability of Textile Products in Canada <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></i></a></p>
