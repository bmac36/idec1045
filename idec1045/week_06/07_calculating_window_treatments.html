        <p>When calculating the amount of fabric needed for any window treatment, you first need to draw in pencil on graph paper a &frac12;&quot; scale drawing of the window with accurate measurements.  This working copy should be kept for future reference and will help you to calculate the amount of fabric needed more accurately. You can also show the dimensions of the treatment you are planning to make sure it will look as you want it to.  This is a very important step and should not be skipped.</p>
        <p>Selecting the fabric and appropriate lining is a main step and then you must make some other decisions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For all treatments you must decide what kind of hardware you will use (colour, style), how long the treatment will be and how high it will hang on the wall. </li>
          <li>In general you would measure the treatment from the top of the rod to the length you want it (&frac12;&quot; from the floor for full length).  The minimum height above a window trim to hang a treatment is 4 inches and anywhere above that to the full ceiling height.  Most decorators prefer to hang high at half-way from the top of the trim to right up to the ceiling.</li>
          <li>If you are covering the window only you need to add 4 inches on each side of the window trim to fully cover the window properly. </li>
          <li>It is always recommended that you hang a treatment to the floor if it is in the budget rather than ending at the bottom of a window for a more professional look.  If you have baseboard heating you must end the treatment just above the heater for fire safety code.  You cannot have a treatment cover baseboard heating.</li>
        </ul>

                <p>Some header styles need some consideration to add to lengths.</p>
                <h3>Pocket gather:</h3>
                <p>For a pocket gather, add 1 &ndash; 2 inches depending on the size of the rod to the finished length to allow for &quot;take up&quot; when gathering on the rod.  If you want a ruffle above the rod add another 1 &ndash; 2 inches for the ruffle above the rod.</p>
                <h3>Grommet: </h3>
                <p>Grommets are rings that are placed 1&quot; down from the top of the finished edge to create the header. This means when you are calculating the finished length you need to add 1” for the fabric above the rod to your total length.</p>
                <h3>Decorative Rods: </h3>
                <p>Decorative rods use rings to hold the drapery and come in various sizes as well for the different rod sizes. </p>
                <p>If you are using a decorative rod with rings, you need to measure the diameter of the ring and deduct that from the length of your drape.  The fabric treatment will hang from the bottom of the ring and not from the rod and so you need to deduct the diameter of the ring from the overall length to determine how long the drape should be.    For example:  if you have a 2&quot; diameter ring on a rod, then the drape would hang 2&quot; below the top of the rod.</p>
                <p>If you are hanging right up to the ceiling with a decorative rod, this means that the wall bracket holding the rod will be right up at the ceiling making the rod about 1” from the ceiling.   You do need to make sure it leaves enough room to fit the finial as well as some finials can be very large and need a bit more room.</p>

                <p>Two story, diagonal or arch windows need special measuring procedures.  Sometimes you need to make a template of the window shape, so when in doubt have a professional installer do a check measure for you for trouble-free installation.  I always get an installer to measure these for me.</p>

            <p>The next series of topics will take you through how to calculate three different treatments. For each one, there will be an information topic, an example topic and then a practice scenario for you to complete on your own. <em>These are critical for your learning and it is very important that you complete each of the practice scenarios to hone your skills for real world application.</em> Remember, incorrect measurements lead to expensive mistakes and unhappy clients. </p>
