              <p>I have listed some kinds of career options that you would be qualified for once you graduate. As a student before graduating you can learn by working for someone in the industry part time to learn more. I have many students who chose to
                do this, telling prospective employers that you are currently taking these courses and what qualifications you will have in the end.</p>
              <p>You may not realize how broad this industry is as there are many areas that you can excel in. This is a growing industry and there is something for every decorator’s area of interest. </p>
              <p> Today, people from all walks of life have an interest in home décor. TV, travel, magazines and so many décor related stores are increasing all the time. One can even find décor items in a grocery store! This growing interest has opened up
                a huge market for the Interior Decorator. Stores all now have experts for customers to consult with and society expects this. </p>
              <p>Throughout this program you are taught to be fully qualified to work in the residential decorating industry upon graduation but just cannot use the words “Interior Designer” together to comply with the law.</p>
