                 <h2> Where did synthetic fibers come from?</h2>
                 <br/>
                 <h3> Why Synthetic Fibers?</h3>
							<p class="extra-space">Historically only natural fibers were used and all had their limitations.  The finest grades had high performance records but the majority were made with much lower standards of cloth and were often uncomfortable and wore out quickly.</p>
							<p>The supply depended on uncontrollable factors like disease, weather and war that impacted the supply.  In the 1800’s scientists began to research artificial silk to try and produce a man-made fiber that could be made more dependably.  </p>

           
                  <br/>
                 <h3> The first Synthetic Fiber</h3>
							<p class="extra-space">In 1855 a Swiss chemist named Audemars got a patent in England for an artificial silk.  He dissolved the inner bark of the mulberry tree and chemically modified it to produce cellulose.  Another chemist named Swan experimented by forcing cellulose liquid through fine holes into a coagulating bath.  This worked similar to the carbon filament used in Edison’s invention of the filament light bulb.  He could use the same process to make textiles.  In 1855 he exhibited some of these fabrics in London and received great interest though none were ready for sale at this time. </p>

                 <h3> The first Commercial fiber</h3>
                 <p>The first commercial fiber was shown at the 1889 Paris exhibition showing artificial silk and two years later the first commercial Rayon plant was opened in France.  In the United States by 1910 the American Viscose Company was formed to make Rayon.  DuPont was a chemist who discovered in his laboratory how to make nylon and he transformed common materials like wood, coal, air and water into fibers.  By the mid 1920’s Rayon was about 50% cheaper than natural fibers like silk and established the basics for the discovery of a new world of manufactured fibers called synthetics.</p>

														<h3>And then there was Nylon</h3>
														<p>Nylon was the first true synthetic fiber and DuPont began its production in 1939.  </p>
														<p>The first nylon stockings were shown that year at the San Francisco Exposition and the first nylon product was the toothbrush.  Parachutes previously made of silk were now produced out of nylon for WW2.  By the 1950’s man-made materials made up about of 20% of fiber needs in textile mills.</p>
