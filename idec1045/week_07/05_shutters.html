                    <p>Shutters are extremely popular in today’s d&eacute;cor.  They come in a traditional style that has narrow slats and the most popular Plantation (California) style that has wide slats from about 2 &ndash; 5 inches deep.  Offered in a variety of neutrals and wood tones, they can also be custom painted to a room colour for an additional charge.  The only caution with these wonderful shutters is to remember that they are like doors and to get to a window you need to open the shutter.  Make sure fixtures and furniture do not impede access to the window.  </p>

                                <h2>Plantation/California:</h2>
															<p>Plantation shutters also known as California shutters are seen everywhere today and are an easy care, bold look that suit many styles of décor.  They operate with a rail in the middle of the shutter that allows them to open and close the slats offering a varying level of privacy and light control.  Some companies also offer a hidden operating rail on the slats.  Plantation shutters can be made from wood, vinyl or a combination of the two that all have varying recommended uses and pricing. </p>
															<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  Be aware that shutters can reduce the amount of light coming into a room by up to 30% when the slats are open.  </p>
															<p>Plantation shutters can be made to fit any shape window any shape window including arched Palladian, diagonal etc. but may not be able to open in odd shapes.  </p>
															<h3>Measuring/ordering:</h3>
															<ul>
																<li>When measuring for shutters, you would take the same kind of measuring process as for all windows, however it is always best to have the company making them do the measuring for either inside or outside mount as there are many factors to consider for a successful end result. </li>
																<li>For example if on an inside mount there is a difference in measurement on the window by more than ½” they must be outside mounted with a frame.  </li>
																<li>There are certain clearance levels as well for window hardware, door handles etc. that only a shutter installer will be aware of prior to ordering.</li>
																<li>If you are using these shutters for assignments during this course, state the window measurements (inside and outside measures) and state that the installer will do final calculations.  You will state if your shutter is to be single opening, double opening, </li>

                                <h2>Sliding Panels:  </h2>
															<p>Sliding panels are increasing in popularity and are panels that slide like a shower door over a window or patio door.  They can be made from Woven wood, California shutters and even sheer fabrics and operate on a sliding track.  They offer a very modern look and are more attractive than the commercial looking old style vertical blinds.  </p>
