Round up to the next full cut size = <strong> 2 cuts</strong> of 54\" fabric to sew together to make the width needed for this treatment.</li> \n </ol> \n <p><img src=\"img/hobbled_roman_solution.jpg\" alt=\" This is the drawing for the solution to the hobbled roman outside mount width portion of the question\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\"></p> \n <h3>Length</h3> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Since outside mount measure 6\" above trim + 6\" trim + 48\" length of window + 6\" bottom trim + 2\" below trim = <strong>68\" finished length</strong>.</li> \n <li>This is not the amount to order. Hobbled roman shade style needs 2.5 times this length to make (included hem and header).</li> \n <li>68\" finished length x 2.5 = 170\" in length to order.</li> \n <li>We need 2 cuts of fabric to make this treatment: 170\" length X 2 cuts = 340\" of fabric to order / 36\" = 9.44 yards of fabric.  Round up to <strong> 9 ½ to 9&nbsp;¾ yards to order</strong>.</li> \n <li><strong>Lining:</strong>  Same amount of lining and interlining needed to order.</li> \n <li>An interlining is a recommended option to give more body to the folds and give a more custom look to the treatment.</li>  \n </ol> ",
