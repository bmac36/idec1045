              <p>As the centuries progressed, often it was the rulers of the kingdom that the style was fashioned and named after. Tudor, Louis IV, Queen Anne etc. This will be covered in detail in the Antiques course. The
                era dictated the style for that society. </p>
              <p>This style was very ornate and heavily patterned with lots of stained wood. The industrial revolution also took place during Queen Victoria’s reign was which changed many lives. Prior to the industrial revolution there was not a large middle
                class, however this started to change during this era. </p>
              <p>Furniture that in the past was all hand crafted, expensive and only for the wealthy, could now be mass produced in factories for far less money. Wallpapers and other household items could also be made in factories to make much more available
                to the middle class. As a result, it was the era of the average people wanting to fill their homes with as much as they could to show wealth and status. For us today it looks like clutter and is far too busy for our tastes. Back then it
                was exciting for the general population to be able to beautify their homes for the first time. The more they could put into their homes the better, and rooms were so full one could often not see any empty wall space.</p>
              <p>Even during this time, there was only one style of décor and homes were furnished for a lifetime and not changed often as we do today.</p>
