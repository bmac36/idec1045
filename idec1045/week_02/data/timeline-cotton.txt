There are different kinds of gins to help pull away the seed.</p>",

The cloth is treated further to improve its appearance by being bleached or dyed or prints added to produce fabric for retail sales and uses.  </p><p>Cotton today is one of the most versatile materials that comes in many weights from very heavy weight to sheer.  Prices can also go from high to low depending on the quality and durability of the fabric.  Cotton is used in all areas of the home from window treatments to upholstery to carpets and clothing.  With the trend to renewable resources, cotton is becoming even more popular as are all natural fibers.</p><p>See your text page 412 for advantages and disadvantages of this kind of fiber.  It is common to mix cotton with other fiber combinations to increase its strength and durability.  People like cotton because it will breathe and is comfortable to wear for example on hot summer days.</p>",
