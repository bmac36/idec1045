      "AnswerText": "<p>Draw Â½\" scale drawing on graph paper as your working copy.</p> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Outside mount means the valance has to come past the side width by 2\" on each side.</li> \n <li>Window width = 4\" return + 2\" past + 6\" trim + 60\" window + 6\" trim + 2\" past + 4\" return = 84\" of space needed.</li> \n <li>Finished width needed <strong>does not include returns</strong> because they go back from the front of the treatment. Finished width = 2\" past + 6\" trim + 60\" window + 6\" trim + 2\" past = <strong>finished width of treatment 76\" </strong> (84\" - 4\" - 4\" returns = 76\").</li> \n <li>Box pleat header treatment needs one full pleat of 18\" and a &frac12; pleat at each corner of the treatment to cover this area.</li> \n <li>4\" return + 2\" past + 6\" trim + 60\" window + 6\" trim + 2\" past + 4\" return = 84\" of space needed + 18\" full pleat in middle and +9\" + 9\" (&frac12; pleats at each corner) = 84\" + 18\" + 9\" + 9\" = 120\" + 6\" selvage = (as valance is sewn together as 1 panel) width of fabric to make this treatment = <strong>126\" in total</strong>.</li> \n <li>Since fabric is 54\" wide, you need to see how many cuts of 54\" fabric you need to allow 126\" of width.</li> \n <li>126\" divided by 54\" = 2.3 cuts. Round up to the next full cut size = <strong>3 cuts</strong> of 54\" fabric to sew together to make the width needed for this treatment.</li> \n </ol> \n <p><img src=\"img/box_solution.jpg\" alt=\" This is the drawing for the solution to the box pleat outside mount width portion of the question\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\"></p> \n <h3>Length</h3> \n <ol class=\"box-number\"> \n <li>Hung at ceiling height and cover 3\" of glass = 18\" from ceiling to glass (12\" wall + 6\" trim) + 3\" over glass = <strong> 21\" finished length</strong>.</li> \n <li>This is not the amount to order. <strong>Box pleat style needs 12\" to make hem and header</strong>.</li> \n <li>21\" finished length + 12\" hem and header = 33\" of fabric length x 3 cuts = 99\" of fabric to order / 36\" = 2.75 yards of fabric. Round up to <strong> 3 yards to order</strong>.</li> \n <li>Since there is no pattern, order the same amount of lining.</li> \n <li>This kind of treatment can look fuller and more finished with an interlining as well. For any treatment that has a large flat surface, it is recommended to add an interlining. An interlining for this treatment would also be the same amount as the regular lining and the fabric amount of 3 yards.</li> \n </ol> ",
