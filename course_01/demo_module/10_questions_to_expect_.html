                    <p>The following questions are important to know about a client in order to begin a job for them. It is not something that you ask your client one at a time in one sitting, however it is a list of questions you need to find out about through your first meeting at their home. The answers will give you a better idea of what your client is wanting and so you can get to know them better.</p>
