              <p>We are using multiple style choices rather than just one as in centuries past that all create a more complex décor that can be difficult for the average person to determine what works well together.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the need for professional help becomes more important to the public. They need help to coordinate colours, styles and textures to give the home a feeling of continuity. Decorators can also help make small spaces feel larger or
                huge spaces feel cozy and comfortable. It is not just for the wealthy any more. Middle class society also want to make their home as comfortable and functional as they can to express their individual style and life style.</p>
              <p><img src="mammoth/img/" alt="">We are also spending more time in our homes. Our entertainment sources are also changing with the addition of computers, large screen TV’s and even projector screen TV’s. We are not only using cable TV now
                but Netflix and internet sources for entertainment purposes. We use technology for home security, and video cameras can see what is going on in our homes when we are not there. We are all connected to the world at all times. Most people
                have a cell phone, tablet, or computer that exposes us to all areas of the world. </p>
              <p>As a society we are travelling the world for vacation and work and being influenced from everywhere. The world is getting smaller and we can see instantly what is happening all over the world.</p>

              <p>As a result, professional assistance from a qualified decorator is important to not make mistakes in selecting colours, furniture and style. Everyone wants their unique style expressed. Everyone deserves a beautiful home no matter what the
                budget. The public needs guidance to take the guess work out of their decorating decisions and that requires training to be able to give the appropriate advice in today’s market. </p>
