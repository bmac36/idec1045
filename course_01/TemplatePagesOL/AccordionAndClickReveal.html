              <p>Artificial light is basically any kind of light that is plugged in through electricity. This kind of light is equally important in a space. Natural light is wonderful during the day but when the sun goes down or the days are cloudy, artificial
                light is needed.</p>
              <p>Artificial light creates safe and comfortable spaces in our homes and allows us to manipulate the light sources and amounts of light we use. The character of a room can be altered by the use of artificial lighting. It can make a room feel
                larger or smaller, more formal or more intimate. It can be used to emphasize an area to accent or to deemphasize an area of less interest. It is a powerful tool to create physical and psychological impact in a space.</p>

                                        <p>When first entering the house lights are on and you can see the whole room and get to your seat safely. When they lower the lights, there’s a feeling of anticipation, and you know something exciting is about to happen. Lastly, they cut all lighting except for the movie screen or stage that is lit with the entertainment. This focuses our attention on the performance. Lighting plays an important role in our experience at the theatre, though we may not be aware.</p>

              <p>In many work spaces like stores and factories, the light is evenly and brightly lighting all areas. It can have a stark feeling and can add to eye strain over a period of time. Offices are now paying more attention to the kind of light used
                and new thought is being given to providing light that is less stressful on the eye, creating better working conditions.</p>
              <p>Lighting can be used commercially to set a mood as well. Restaurants use lighting to create a certain mood. Fast food restaurants have lots of bright, warm light that creates a warm and active feeling, while fine dining restaurants use low
                light and candles to create a relaxing atmosphere that is more calming and intimate. We do the same when dining at home and dim the lights to eat at a dinner party or use low light to watch TV. The light helps to create a mood for our
                enjoyment and activity. </p>
              <p>There are 3 kinds of artificial light.</p>

                <p>Ambient also known as general lighting is a kind of light that lights the whole room. A central ceiling light, a series of track or pot lights or lamps with translucent shades can do this job. Natural light from windows and skylights that
                floods a room can also be ambient light during the day. Ambient light is meant to pay equal attention to all areas of the room, colours and fabrics and can minimize the bulkiness of furniture. It is not a kind of light good enough for
                reading however and is not as comfortable as other kinds of light sources. This kind of lighting can be found in direct (shade on the top and light casing downward) or indirect light (shade on the bottom and light casting upward) direction.
                Indirect light is softer on the eyes and depending on the positioning can throw too much light upward.</p>

               <p>Task lighting is a direct functional kind of light that is for a specific purpose like reading, cooking, eating or grooming among other uses. Room like kitchens, bathrooms and laundry rooms use direct light attached to walls or ceilings
                to shine on work surfaces. Other rooms may use lamps that cast a light on a table surface or lap to read or work. The important thing is to protect the eye from the bulb. Task lighting is an intense light that casts a light in a pool in
                one area therefore attracting the light to that spot. Examples are a desk lamp for working, lamp on an end table or floor lamp for reading, under cabinet lights, recess pot lights or the light over the stove or sink for meal preparation.
                The light in a specific spot is bright enough to do the task without straining the eyes.</p>
              <p>The varying intensity can give distinction to different areas of a room making it feel larger by light and shadows. A work area should have 100 – 150 watts of incandescent light or 40 – 50 watts of fluorescent light for each task area. The
                new compact efficient bulbs are meant to burn like an incandescent light and though lower wattage output will show on the label what the lower wattage is to resemble. </p>
              <p>A compact efficient bulb converts the power to more efficient light than a regular incandescent bulb.</p>

                curio lighting, spot lights in plants, buffet and accent lamps, candles and fireplaces. It is usually from 25 – 60 watts of incandescent light <strong>wattage.</strong></p>

                            <h2>Helpful Hint</h2>
              <p>Overall there should be all 3 kinds of lighting in a room. Lights can be lowered in wattage by the use of dimmer switches. I believe all overhead lights should be on a dimmer to allow the adjustment of mood and brightness in a room.</p>
