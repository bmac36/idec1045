                           <h3>Why are Fabrics Important?</h3>
                           <p>Fabrics are used by everyone all over the world on a daily basis.  We often take them for granted without thinking much about them &mdash; where the fabrics come from, the kind of material they are made from or what they are called.  As a decorator, it is important to have a basic understanding of all kinds of fabrics, their pros and cons, uses and how they will work in various window treatments in our homes.  There are many things to consider when selecting window treatments and the fabric you select to use for them.  Having a basic knowledge of different weaves, finishes and patterns will help you choose the right fabric for the right window treatment.</p>

                           <!--Main - Right Col-->
                       <div class="col-xs-9 col-xs-offset-2 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-0 col-md-5 col-md-offset-0 col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-0">
                          
                           <h3>Fabric Blends</h3>
                           <p>Mixing or blending different fiber content is quite common in window treatments and can give positive qualities of each kind of fiber to improve an end result.  It is also used to sometimes save on the cost.  Many of todayâ€™s fabrics blend to increase durability, enhance visual appeal or to improve the dying quality of a fabric.  Even a 5-10% fiber blend can make a small difference in the functioning of a fabric.  For example, polyester is often added to cotton for a more wrinkle free and soil resistant material and also adds strength the fabric.  Nylon added to wool can increase its strength.  Cotton added to wool will prevent it from shrinking or matting as easily and acetate added to a fabric can add a sheen to it. </p>
