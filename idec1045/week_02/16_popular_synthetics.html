        <h3>Rayon</h3>
        <p>Rayon is organic and made from cellulose of wood or cotton.  It can be made to mimic natural fibers of cotton, silk, linen and wool. </p>

        <h3>Acetate</h3>
        <p>Acetate is organic and made from wood pulp or cotton.  It is one of the first synthetic fibers and first was produced into cellulose film for motion pictures.  It has many similarities to rayon and is used often today for its good drape and to add sheen to other fiber content.</p>

        <h3>Nylon</h3>
        <p>Nylon is inorganic and made from coal.  It is used for its resiliency and good drape quality and colour retention.</p>

        <h3>Olefin</h3>
        <p>Olefin is inorganic and made from carbon and hydrogen.  It has a kind of waxy feel, is resistant to moisture, is stain resistant and has low static. </p>

        <h3>Polyester</h3>
        <p>Polyester is inorganic and derives from chemicals.  It is a strong versatile fiber that is often mixed with natural fibers to improve strength.</p>

        <h3>Affordability of Synthetics</h3>
        <p>While synthetic fibers were originally made to be more affordable than natural fibers, today this is not the case.  Some synthetics can be less expensive but with the development and refinement of the manufacturing process they may not be any less expensive than natural fibers today.  Some polyester can look and feel exactly like silk for example but has benefits of not being as sensitive to sunlight and can be washable which contributes to the cost.</p>

            <h3>In My Experience</h3>
            <p>Many times I have given my seamstress a polyester fabric that looks like silk and she cannot tell the difference.  She has been in the industry for over 40 years and with the advances in manufacturing process, she cannot tell the difference between real and synthetic silk anymore and will call me to check the fabric content for sun protection.  The fact that these fabrics can fool an expert like my seamstress, shows just how far synthetics have come!</p>
            <p> I will use a polyester silk for families with busy lifestyles and small children so that the fabric can be easily washed and stand up to heavy use.</p>
