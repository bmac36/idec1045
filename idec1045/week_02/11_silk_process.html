					<h3>In My Experience</h3>
					<div class="row">
					<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
					<p>I had a client who had a bad previous experience with silk roman shades.  Within 6 months of installation they had all rotted at the fold lines of the shade!  This was the fault of the previous person who ordered them for her because she did not use the correct lining with the silk to prevent the sun from reaching the silk.  It is important for any decorator to know about the pros and cons of materials to create a quality treatment for every client.  When I had her silk treatments made I was sure to protect the silk from the sun and she has had them now for several years with no damage.  I will explain what I did to protect the silk in a future lesson.</p>

            <h2>Silk Facts</h2>
						<p> Silk has a very strong tensile strength meaning that it can withstand a lot of pulling type pressure without breaking.  This is not to be confused with durability or abrasion resistance however, therefore silk will not stand up to heavy wear like other fibers and it is easily damaged by sunlight.  Silk can have many different appearances and depending on the filaments used to produce it, silk can look like cotton or synthetic. </p>
						<p>Silk dyes easily and has good colour retention making this cloth an excellent choice for clothing, light upholstery use, carpeting and window treatments. It has excellent hang on drapery with great sheen and an elegant look.</p>
						<p>Dupioni silk is made from a cocoon of two silkworms being nested together.  The luster of the thread shimmers and changes colour in the light.  In spinning the double strand is not separated giving this effect.</p>
